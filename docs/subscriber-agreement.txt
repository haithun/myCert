Upon Symantec's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Symantec will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Symantec will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement.

Upon receipt of such notice, Symantec may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.  
3.  Collateral Services.  Symantec may make available to you additional Services such as, but not limited to: (i) daily scanning of your website for malicious code; (ii) vulnerability assessment of your network environment; (iii) Seal services; and/or (iv) access to the account management features and functionality through a web-based console.

SYMANTEC CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.
